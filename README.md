Web Assessment for JFSD

**REFLECTION**

**What did you like about this project?**
I get to reinforce what I've learned from the past couple of weeks and get to relearn the HTML
and CSS concepts. I also really like the complexity and evolution of CSS.


**What did you struggle with in this project?**
Grasping the many layers of CSS (flex-box alone can take years to master) and applying the appropriate properties and 
composition of divs alongside chosen styles.

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
None that I can think of at the moment. Maybe more alloted time to accomplish the project.
