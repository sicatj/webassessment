Web Assessment for JFSD

**REFLECTION**

**What did you like about this project?**
I get to reinforce what I've learned from the past couple of weeks and get to relearn the HTML
and CSS concepts. I also really like the complexity and evolution of CSS.  It is both fun and challenging.


**What did you struggle with in this project?**
Grasping the many layers of CSS (flex-box alone can take months -or years?- to master) and applying the appropriate properties and 
composition of divs alongside chosen styles. 

I've also struggled with sections where I made the decision to hide items in the with under the mobile media query VS creating an entire div for the mobile version of the section itself.  I guess I wanted to play around and see what the difference is. I did not have the time to change that decision, in summation. But this was a really good practice.

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
None that I can think of at the moment. Maybe more alloted time to accomplish the project and more specifications (like what is expected elements behavior under screen change VS just pixel distances/specs beteen as flexbox items deviate to adhere to expanding/shrinking screen).
